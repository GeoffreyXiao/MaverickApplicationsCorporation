3.1 User Interfaces
The user interface will be a dashboard page that can lead your navigation in the application.  Features required include the main or dashboard page, a page for new users without an account to create an account, a forgotten password page which will allow you to reset your password, a profile page with a profile picture specific to that user's profile, and an account settings page to change your password or profile picture.

3.2 Hardware Interfaces
The software will require a MySQL database for information tied to users including their tweets and profile picture.

3.3 Software Interfaces
This Project will use JQuery for relation between JavaScript and HTML, and use PHP for the bridge between MySQL and JavaScript.

3.4 Communication Interfaces
The project will use communication between the MySQL database and the browser by using PHP to connect between the server-side MySQL and client-side JavaScript.
